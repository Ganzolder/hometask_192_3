            <h1 align="center">What is Vaginal Steaming?</h1>
            <p>Vaginal steaming is an ancient practice that is thought to be beneficial in cleansing the vagina and
                uterus, regulating the menstrual cycle, easing the pain of period cramps and bloating, and aiding in
                healing and soothing after childbirth. The practice can also be very meditative.</p>

            <p>The Yoni steam process involves sitting over a steaming pot of herb-infused water, generally for about
                10-30 minutes per session depending on your bodyâ€™s constitution and menstrual cycle history. As the
                steam rises and the herbs penetrate vaginal tissue, it is thought that the vagina and uterus are
                cleansed and soothed.</p>

            <p>You can receive your vaginal steam session as a spa treatment or at home. We encourage you to connect
                with a practitioner for further support, instructions, and personalized yoni steam herb recipe
                recommendations.</p>
